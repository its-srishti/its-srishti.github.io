In 2022, over 40 emerging economies battled inflation rates above 10%, but few stories were as raw as that of Sri Lanka, where inflation crossed 60%, and hospitals ran out of medicine. Amid spiraling food and fuel prices, central banks around the world clung to a single prescription: price stability. It sounded noble. But as interest rates soared and public services shrank, a quiet question began to rise from the margins: Who is stability really for? And what happens when the pursuit of macroeconomic order forgets the people it was meant to protect?

For decades, the gold standard of monetary policy has been “inflation targeting”—a clean, quantifiable metric that assures investors, anchors expectations, and promotes policy credibility. In India, this meant formally setting a 4% inflation target with a 2% buffer on either side. In theory, this shields citizens from the corrosive effects of runaway prices. In practice, the outcomes are more complicated.

Consider this: in rural India or urban Nigeria, over 60% of household income goes to food and fuel. These are also the sectors most vulnerable to supply shocks—crop failure, global oil spikes, or disruptions like COVID. When inflation in these sectors rises, central banks often respond by raising interest rates to cool down the economy—even if the cause is not excess demand but external or supply-side shocks.

This decoupling shows that monetary policy cannot carry the weight of inclusive growth alone. Unemployment isn’t just a side effect, it’s an economic failure that price stability often overlooks.</em></p>

But here’s the trap: raising rates doesn’t make onions cheaper. It doesn’t bring down fuel prices set by international markets. What it does do is slow down credit, increase borrowing costs for governments, and squeeze small businesses. In Brazil and Nigeria, aggressive rate hikes in 2022–2023 had limited effects on inflation but significantly worsened job markets and public deficits.

Meanwhile, inflation targeting often pushes governments to cut fiscal spending, for fear of stoking prices further. This can lead to undermining essential services—healthcare, education, employment programs. As inflation drops on paper, the real economy may be bleeding. And the poor, once again, are left to pay for the illusion of “stability.”

This is where the disconnect becomes political. Inflation targeting, while useful, is not neutral. It often protects creditors more than debtors, savers more than wage earners, and global markets more than local livelihoods. Central bank “credibility” becomes code for appeasing bond markets—even when people at home are struggling to find work, food, or functioning schools.

Emerging economies need a people-first monetary framework. This doesn’t mean abandoning inflation targets—it means redefining their purpose. Central banks should adopt dual mandates, like the U.S. Federal Reserve, which balances price stability with employment. In India, for instance, this would mean inflation policy cannot be judged in isolation from unemployment rates or financial inclusion.

Additionally, fiscal and monetary coordination must replace the current “don’t talk to each other” doctrine. If high interest rates kill investment and starve welfare programs, the system isn’t stable—it’s just cold.
Ultimately, price stability should not be seen as an abstract goal. It is a tool, a means to improve well-being, not a number to be worshipped. And when that number comes at the cost of rising inequality or social despair, we must question who the system is really serving.

When inflation targets become a scoreboard for policymakers, the scoreboard can start mattering more than the match. Price stability is not the destination—it’s the road. And roads are only worth taking if they lead people somewhere better.
